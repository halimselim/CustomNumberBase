# CustomNumberBase

I needed a number base convertor and I could not find any to meet my requirements, so I tried to make one.
This class lets you define your own set of symbols to use as digits.
And also can handle very large numbers.

Default base is 29 and default symbols are the letters in Turkish alphabet.
Of course you change them with the constructor.(String[] array length will be the base)


a = 0
b = 1
.
.
z = 28
ba = 29
bb = 30
.
